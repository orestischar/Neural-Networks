# Neural-Networks
Assignments for the NTUA ECE Neural Networks 2019-2020 class 

In the 1st Assignement we implemented different classifiers on two different datasets (one in each notebook) and optimized them by analysing their different metric results.

In the 2nd Assignement we implemented an optimization on a movie recommendation system and also analysed the topological and semantic represantion of the movies using SOM. 

In the 3rd Assignement we developed neural networks (MLP, CNNs, transfer learning) and tried different optimizations (either on the accuracy or concerning time and space).

The specific questions can be seen in the respective notebooks.
